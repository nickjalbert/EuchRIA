Experimenting with Rich Internet Applications
Using the Adobe Flex Framework

Project Makefile assumes the Flex compilers are in your path (mxmlc etc).  If
Flex compilers are not in your path, update $(EUCHRIA_ROOT)/Makefile to reflect
the path of your mxmlc compiler.

Project utility scripts assume environment variable $EUCHRIA_ROOT is defined
and points to the root directory of the project (e.g. export
EUCHRIA_ROOT=/home/nick/Euchria).
